# `cs61a-apps`

Welcome to the CS 61A docs! This wiki contains documentation for all
of our apps, which you can peruse through in the Github repo. It also
contains information about how various software works and how you can
contribute to it. We plan on including installation guides so that you
can use these tools in your own courses.

```{warning}
This is a work in progress, so please bear with us while we put it together!
