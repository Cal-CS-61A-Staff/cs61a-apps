## Main

This file contains all of the code for redirecting. It tries to retrieve
from a set LOOKUP dictionary and if it doesn't exist tries to directly
get a url from the inst.eecs website. 'lookup()' retrieves the redirect
link and 'catch_all()' is how the code is lookup is called.

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: redirect.main
    :members:
```
