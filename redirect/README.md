# `redirect`

This utility sets up different redirects from the CS 61A website. To add new
redirects, edit the lookup dictionary in `main.py`. At the end of a semester,
edit `deploy.yaml` to include `<semester>.cs61a.org`. This target will
automatically redirect to `inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/<semester>`.

This app has no local setup instructions, because it is not meant to be run
locally.
