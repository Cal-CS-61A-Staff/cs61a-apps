  STARTING TEST
  
  # Create two files: f1 and f2. 
  # We explicitly depend on f1, but rely on an Input() to depend on f2 based on f1
  CREATING FILE f1.txt with contents: "V0 (f1.txt)"
  CREATING FILE f2.txt with contents: "V0 (f2.txt)"
  CREATING rule RuleA
  
  BUILDING rule RuleA
  RUNNING run.py --mode=INPUT --id=0 in working directory
  RUNNING run.py --mode=INPUT --id=0 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt', 'f2.txt']
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=1 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt', 'f2.txt']
  COMPLETED BUILDING rule RuleA
  
  # We now modify f2 so we also depend on a new file f3
  CREATING FILE f3.txt with contents: "V0 (f3.txt)"
  UPDATING FILE f2.txt with contents: "V1 (f2.txt)"
