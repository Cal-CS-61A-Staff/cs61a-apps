  STARTING TEST
  
  # We have a source file f1
  # RuleA produces some output f2 from f1
  CREATING FILE f1.txt with contents: "V0 (f1.txt)"
  CREATING rule RuleA
  
  # RuleB produces some further output f3 from f2
  CREATING rule RuleB
  
  # Building RuleB requires f2 to be built from f1, then f3 to be built from f2
  BUILDING rule RuleB
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=0 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt']
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=1 in scratch directory with files ['RuleA.output']
  COMPLETED BUILDING rule RuleB
  
  # We update file f1, but without affecting th output f2.
  UPDATING FILE f1.txt with contents: "V1 (f1.txt)"
  
  # So we just need to rerun RuleA, and then can pull the output of RuleB from cache
  BUILDING rule RuleB
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=0 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt']
  COMPLETED BUILDING rule RuleB
  
  # However, this time we modify f1 in such a way that the output f2 is also modified.
  UPDATING FILE f1.txt with contents: "V2 (f1.txt)"
  
  # So both RuleA and RuleB will need to be rerun
  BUILDING rule RuleB
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=0 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt']
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=1 in scratch directory with files ['RuleA.output']
  COMPLETED BUILDING rule RuleB
