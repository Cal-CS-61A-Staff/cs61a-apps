  STARTING TEST
  
  # Create two files: f1 and f2
  # Initially, f1 will dynamically depend on f2
  CREATING FILE f1.txt with contents: "V0 (f1.txt)"
  CREATING FILE f2.txt with contents: "V0 (f2.txt)"
  CREATING rule RuleA
  
  BUILDING rule RuleA
  RUNNING run.py --mode=INPUT --id=0 in working directory
  RUNNING run.py --mode=INPUT --id=0 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt', 'f2.txt']
  RUNNING run.py --mode=SH --id=1 in scratch directory with files ['f1.txt', 'f2.txt']
  COMPLETED BUILDING rule RuleA
  
  # We then modify f1 so it no longer depends on f2, and also delete f2 altogether
  UPDATING FILE f1.txt with contents: "V1 (f1.txt)"
  DELETING FILE f2.txt
  
  # Now, when we build the rule, the cached input will try to look up f2, but will fail to do so.
  # However, this error should be caught and ignored, because dynamic deps are not guaranteed to be correct
