To change how grades are processed before being uploaded to howamidoing, take a look at `assemble.py`. To change how grades are exported from Gradescope and the relevant columns are saved, take a look at `gs_export.py`. To update variables for the current semester, take look at `config.json`. This is the only file that should require changes!
