title: EECS Grade Display Tool
---


This is a tool meant to display and forecast grades for lower-div EECS classes at UC Berkeley.

To develop, install the python dependencies in `server/requirements.txt`, run `yarn`, then run `yarn dev`. `yarn dev` will concurrently run `python3 main.py` (backend) and `yarn start` (frontend).
