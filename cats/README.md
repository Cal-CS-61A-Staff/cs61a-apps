## How to develop:

`yarn` to install dependencies - do this when you first download it!

`cd server && python flask_app.py & yarn start` - start web server and webpack dev server

`yarn build` - generate built version in `deploy` folder, that can be pasted into `berkeley-cs61a`

`yarn build && yarn deploy` - build and deploy to <https://cats.cs61a.org>
